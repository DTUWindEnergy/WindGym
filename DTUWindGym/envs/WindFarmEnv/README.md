# WindFarmEnv


## Description 
This is a gymnasium environment for wind farm simulations. It is built on the [DYNAMIKS](https://gitlab.windenergy.dtu.dk/DYNAMIKS/dynamiks)

Note that there exist both a single and multi agent env now.
## Examples

Some examples of the uses can be seen in the Examples folder.

An example animation of the turbines in the flow.
